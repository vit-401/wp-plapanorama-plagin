# React App Deployment on WordPress Site

This guide outlines the steps to deploy your React project within a WordPress theme. 

## Project Structure

The React app should be placed in the `react-app` folder within your WordPress theme directory: wp-content/themes/houzez-child/react-app/

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the React Project**:
   Before deploying, ensure your project is built for production. Run the following command in your React project directory:
   ```sh
   npm run build


This will create a build directory with the production-ready files.

Update Image Links:
In the main.js file within your React app, update the image links to reflect the correct path:

js
Copy code
const imagePath = "wp-content/themes/houzez-child/react-app/static/media/";
Modify functions.php:
Ensure that your theme's functions.php file includes the necessary code to enqueue your React app's CSS and JS files. Example:

php
Copy code
function enqueue_react_app() {
    wp_enqueue_style('react-app-css', get_template_directory_uri() . '/react-app/static/css/main.css');
    wp_enqueue_script('react-app-js', get_template_directory_uri() . '/react-app/static/js/main.js', array(), null, true);
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'enqueue_react_app');
Check and Fix Links in Theme Files:
Make sure all links in your theme files point to the correct locations. Check the react-app folder and ensure all paths are correct.

Fix CSS Files:
Sometimes CSS files may need to be adjusted. This can be done directly within the hosting file management system. Navigate to the appropriate CSS files and make necessary changes.




Development and Cleanup
Development Code: Ensure you remove any development-specific code before building the project for production.
Cleanup: Always double-check that no development-only scripts or styles are left in your functions.php or any other theme files.
Additional Tips
File Management: Use the hosting provider's file management system to upload and manage your files.
Testing: After deployment, thoroughly test your site to ensure all links are correct and the React app is functioning as expected.
Example Commands
To build the project:

sh
Copy code
npm run build
To upload the build files:

Use your hosting provider's file manager or an FTP client.
Place the files in the wp-content/themes/houzez-child/react-app/ directory.
Troubleshooting
Broken Links: Ensure all paths in your React app are relative and correctly point to the wp-content/themes/houzez-child/react-app/static/media/ directory.
CSS Issues: Directly edit CSS files in the hosting file management system if styles do not apply correctly.
By following these steps, you can successfully deploy your React project within a WordPress theme and ensure it functions correctly.
